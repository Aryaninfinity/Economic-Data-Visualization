Economic Data Visualization Tool

Overview
The Economic Data Visualization Tool is a web-based application designed to dynamically fetch and visualize economic indicators from the World Bank API. Users can select a country and an economic indicator (e.g., GDP, inflation rate) to generate interactive charts that display the data over time.

Features
User Input for Country and Indicator: Allows users to specify the country and economic indicator they're interested in.
Dynamic Data Fetching: Automatically fetches data from the World Bank API based on user input.
Interactive Charts: Displays the fetched economic data in an interactive chart format, making it easy to understand trends over time.

Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
CanvasJS for charting
World Bank API for economic data

Getting Started

Prerequisites
A modern web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Local Setup
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Aryaninfinity/economic-data-visualization.git
cd economic-data-visualization

Open the Project
